# 777PROJECT -  Crypto Trading Bot

## Project Overview
The 777PROJECT is an advanced, modular, and highly configurable cryptocurrency trading bot. It leverages machine learning, comprehensive technical analysis, and multi-timeframe strategies to identify trading opportunities. The bot is capable of running in live trading mode with Coinbase, performing in-depth backtesting, and sending real-time notifications via Telegram.

## Features
-   **Machine Learning Core**: Utilizes a suite of models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) to generate and enhance trading signals.
-   **Live Trading with Coinbase**: Integrated with the Coinbase Cloud API for executing live trades.
-   **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: Aggregates data from various timeframes (e.g., 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d) for more robust signals.
-   **Advanced Technical Analysis**: Employs a wide range of indicators from `pandas-ta`, including RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, EMAs, and more.
-   **Comprehensive Backtesting**: A powerful backtesting engine to simulate and evaluate strategies on historical data.
-   **Data Management**: Includes tools for downloading and storing historical market data in a local SQLite database.
-   **Telegram Notifications**: Sends detailed notifications for generated signals and executed trades.
-   **Highly Configurable**: Easily configure symbols, timeframes, and strategies through a `.env` file.
-   **Interactive CLI**: A user-friendly command-line interface to control the bot's functions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
-   Python 3.9+
-   `pip` (Python package installer)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/W33Z4RD/777
    cd 777PROJECT
    ```

2.  **Create a Python virtual environment (Best pratice):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Install TA-Lib:**
    This project requires the TA-Lib library. A helper script is provided for Linux/macOS.
    ```bash
    chmod +x install_talib.sh
    ./install_talib.sh
    ```
    For Windows, please refer to the official TA-Lib installation guides.

5.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This file will hold your API keys and custom configurations.

    ```
    # .env example
    # Coinbase API Credentials
    COINBASE_API_KEY="organizations/YOUR_ORG_ID/apiKeys/YOUR_API_KEY_UUID"
    COINBASE_API_SECRET="-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY\n-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----"
    EXCHANGE_SANDBOX="true" # Use "true" for sandbox, "false" for live trading

    # Telegram Bot Credentials
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
    TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID"

    # Optional: Override default symbols or timeframes
    # SYMBOLS='["BTC/USDT", "ETH/USDT"]'
    # TIMEFRAMES='["1h", "4h"]'
    # UPDATE_INTERVAL=300 # 5 minutes
    ```

## Usage
The primary entry point for the bot is `main_enhanced.py`.

```bash
python main_enhanced.py
```

You will be presented with an interactive menu:
